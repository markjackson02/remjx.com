[Redis](https://redis.io/) is a super fast key:value database typically used to hold ephemeral data. Here are some tips & tricks I have found useful:

- [Run redis-server on Windows startup](https://gist.github.com/cromat/a065136db5bdc40f21dc139567ad0340). On my Windows machine, I have Ubuntu installed via [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) which I use to run redis locally. This gist shows how you can automate running redis-server automatically on Windows startup. Before, I had to manually open Ubuntu and run redis-server every time I reboot my machine. Now, it happens automatically!
