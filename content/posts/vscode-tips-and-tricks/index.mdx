[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my code editor of choice. Here are some tips & tricks I have found useful:

- When defining a [snippet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) use [Code2Snippets for VSCode](https://codepen.io/cbejensen/pen/WXLxaE). At least at the time of writing, you have to define the body of the snippet using an array, one element per line. This tool converts multi-line code into a compatible array for your snippets-definition.json file.
